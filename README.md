# PAO1\_fadE\_dNdS code repository

This is the code repository for mapping and analyzing the dN/dS result of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ PAO1 PA0506 (fadE1) and PA0508 (fadE2) evolution selectivities. The code allows mapping the dN/dS values onto the resolved PA14 fadE1 and fadE2 apo-form protein structures via PyMol software (v2.5.0).

For the dN/dS (cross-organismal) whole genome analysis pipeline for evolution selectivity, please visit the GitHub page for [dNdS_scan](https://github.com/ph-u/dNdS_scan).
